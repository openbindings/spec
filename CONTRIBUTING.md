# Contributing to the OpenBindings specification

Thanks for helping improve OpenBindings.

## Where changes go

- The **working copy** of the spec is `openbindings.md`.
- Released snapshots live under `versions/<x.y.z>/` and are **immutable**.

## Rules

- PRs SHOULD target `openbindings.md`.
- PRs MUST NOT edit existing released snapshots under `versions/`.

## Workflow

1. Open a PR describing the motivation and the change.
2. Keep PRs small and reviewable where possible.
3. Discuss tradeoffs openly; the goal is deterministic, interoperable tooling.
