# OpenBindings Initiative Governance

This project is run as the **OpenBindings Initiative**.

The goal is to keep the OpenBindings specification vendor-neutral, implementable, and stable for adopters.

## Roles

- **Editors**: maintain the spec text and steward releases. The current editor list is in `EDITORS.md`.
- **Contributors**: anyone who participates via issues and pull requests.

## Decision making

- Changes are proposed via pull requests against `openbindings.md`.
- Editors seek rough consensus on meaningful changes.
- If consensus cannot be reached, editors make a decision with a bias toward:
  - interoperability and determinism
  - backward compatibility (within a major spec version)
  - clarity and minimalism

## Releases

- Released versions under `versions/<x.y.z>/` are immutable.
- See `RELEASING.md` for the release process.

## Sponsorship

Infrastructure and hosting for the OpenBindings project are currently sponsored by [Endpin LLC](https://endpin.io). The specification itself is governed independently under the editors model described above.

## Trademarks (intent)

"OpenBindings" is intended to be a community standard name. Trademark policy may be published as the project grows.
