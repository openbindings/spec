# Security Policy

OpenBindings is primarily a **specification repository**. There is no hosted service to "attack" here, but security issues can still arise from:

- ambiguous or unsafe guidance that could lead to vulnerable implementations
- scripts or other executable assets in this repo

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you've found a security issue that should be handled privately:

- Email: hello@openbindings.com
- GitHub: Matthew Clevenger [@clevengermatt](https://github.com/clevengermatt)

If the issue is not sensitive, you can open a public issue instead.

## What to include

- a clear description of the issue and impact
- affected files/sections (and spec version if relevant)
- proof-of-concept or reproduction steps (if applicable)
- suggested remediation (if you have one)

## Disclosure

Please do not publicly disclose security-sensitive issues until the maintainers have had a chance to respond and coordinate a fix.
