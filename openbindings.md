# OpenBindings Specification (v0.2.0)

## Abstract

OpenBindings is a portable interface description format; its documents are OBIs (OpenBindings interface documents). An OBI declares each operation once, as a protocol-independent contract with optional per-value input and output schemas, then relates it to concrete realizations through bindings and to named consumption points through dependencies. The contract lives at the operation layer; protocols live at the binding layer.

```json
{
  "openbindings": "0.2.0",
  "operations": {
    "createTask": {
      "input": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": { "title": { "type": "string" } },
        "required": ["title"]
      },
      "output": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": { "id": { "type": "string" } }
      }
    }
  },
  "sources": {
    "httpApi": {
      "kind": "example.openapi@1",
      "content": { "location": "https://example.com/openapi.json" }
    }
  },
  "bindings": {
    "createTask.http": {
      "operation": "createTask",
      "source": "httpApi",
      "content": { "target": "#/paths/~1tasks/post" }
    }
  }
}
```

The kinds in this document's examples (`example.openapi@1`, `example.mcp@1`, `example.grpc@1`, `my-cli.usage@1`) and the shapes of their `content`, such as `{ "location": … }` on a source and `{ "target": … }` on a binding, are illustrative; only a kind gives `content` meaning ([§6](#6-kinds)).

New readers may prefer the [§4. Overview](#4-overview-informative) walkthrough. From [§2. Core invariants](#2-core-invariants) on, the text is normative except where marked informative; conformance is judged by the numbered rules of [§10](#10-conformance).

## Status of this document

This is **version 0.2.0** of the OpenBindings specification. This text is the unreleased working draft of that version; the latest release is **0.1.0** (immutable released snapshots live under `versions/`). Until 0.2.0 is released, this working draft stands in for that release wherever this text speaks of the release whose text a conclusion applies, and such a conclusion names the draft and its revision ([OBI-T-09](#103-tool-rules)). It is pre-1.0, and minor-version revisions MAY include breaking changes per [§8. Versioning](#8-versioning). Substantive changes are recorded in `CHANGELOG.md` and cite rule identifiers (`OBI-D-##`/`OBI-T-##`) where applicable, each under the version it belongs to.

## 1. Positioning and scope

This specification defines an interface document model, not a client-server protocol or runtime API: an OBI may be authored and supplied independently of the software it describes, which need not publish, receive, or interpret it.

OpenBindings sits one layer above protocol-specific interface specifications such as OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, gRPC, and MCP, which describe how to interact with particular protocols and endpoints. An OBI describes operations (what a service can do rather than how), the realizations bindings declare for them, the operations a described component consumes, and the shared names by which operations can be recognized. It relates these across protocols, complementing the artifacts its sources carry or point at.

### 1.1. Distinguishing features

- **One operation, many bindings.** One operation contract can be realized over multiple protocols at once without duplicating the contract.
- **One contract, either direction.** Bindings declare realizations of an operation; named dependencies declare where the described component consumes realizations, without splitting the operation map into provider and consumer copies.
- **Vendor-independent correspondence.** An operation can adopt the name a shared contract publishes, so consumers recognize it by that name rather than by who runs the service ([§5.1](#51-operations)).
- **Location-independent references, offline-decidable conformance.** OBI-defined references never depend on where a document was obtained, and every document rule is decidable from the document and locally available resources (invariants 4 and 5).

### 1.2. Out of scope

The core defines the document envelope and each operation's caller-facing value contracts. Two other parties decide the rest:

- **The source's kind** decides how a source and its bindings are read, beginning with what their `content` means ([§6](#6-kinds) lists the matters). Wherever this specification says a matter is read under a source's kind, it marks this boundary: it neither asserts that a definition or implementation of the kind exists nor gives one authority over the document model.
- **Tools** decide whether and when to invoke, and whether to validate values at runtime (invariant 2). They decide how to choose among bindings (candidate construction, filtering, fallback, and tie-breaking) and how to compose dependencies with providers (discovering candidate bindings, judging their compatibility, choosing among them, and registering, configuring, authenticating, or monitoring the chosen target). They set their own security posture and make any compatibility judgment or matching beyond the exact kind comparison and name resolution the core fixes ([OBI-T-01](#103-tool-rules), [OBI-T-07](#103-tool-rules)). This specification defines no invoker (a tool that acts on bindings to carry out operations), so invocation lifecycle, retries, credential flow, sandboxing, and rate limiting are implementation concerns.

OpenBindings also does not:

- **Serve as an authoring language.** It defines the interchange document; authoring tools and compilation workflows, such as TypeSpec and Smithy, are outside it.
- **Define acquisition or publication** ([§1.3](#13-obtaining-an-obi)).
- **Maintain registries.** Kinds, correspondence names, and format conventions are author-assigned; this specification provides no registry or ownership test.
- **Specify integrity, signing, or attestation.** These compose externally ([Appendix A](#appendix-a-canonical-serialization-informative)).

### 1.3. Obtaining an OBI

An OBI may be obtained through local files, packages, standard input, embedded resources, network retrieval, or any other mechanism, and the core reads it the same way whichever mechanism delivered it (invariant 4, [§7](#7-reference-resolution)).

---

## 2. Core invariants

The rules in this specification instantiate six invariants: design constraints the numbered rules carry out, while conformance is judged by the rules ([§10](#10-conformance)). Other sections cite them by number, and most of their terms are defined in [§3](#3-terminology).

1. **Value contracts.** Operation `input` and `output` schemas govern each value that crosses the operation's caller-facing boundary, one value at a time. Interaction pattern, cardinality, framing, completion, and lifecycle are read under the source's kind.
2. **Enabling, not invoking.** A binding declares a realization of its operation through a source; the document alone need not suffice to identify, reach, or act on a target. A dependency carries no target and becomes actionable only through tool-defined composition with a realization. No rule in this specification obligates a tool to invoke, satisfy a dependency, validate values at runtime because it invokes, or handle failures in a prescribed way. Rules about validation semantics apply to tools that claim the corresponding capability.
3. **Bounded interpretation.** The operation carries the caller-facing value contracts. This specification defines neither the meaning of source or binding `content` nor the addresses, representations, references, value adaptation, and interaction a tool may use when acting on them. A kind does not change the meaning of core fields.
4. **Context-free references.** No OBI-defined reference ([§7](#7-reference-resolution)) resolves against the URI a document was fetched from, so the document model means the same thing however a document was obtained. Source and binding `content` are outside that reference rule (invariant 3). OBI assigns no document identity; `name` and `version` are labels.
5. **Offline-decidable conformance.** Document conformance is an objective property of the document under the text it is judged against, decidable from the document plus locally available resources (the derived schema, [OBI-D-02](#102-document-rules), and the JSON Schema 2020-12 meta-schemas, [OBI-D-10](#102-document-rules)). No document rule's outcome depends on network state, so a document's conformance changes only when a correction changes that text ([§8.1](#81-openbindings-field-specification-version), [OBI-T-09](#103-tool-rules)). A validator's inability to decide a rule is not itself evidence of non-conformance.
6. **Decentralized extension.** Kinds and shared correspondence names are author-assigned: this specification assigns no authority over them, the model requires no registry, and no kind is implicitly dereferenced to be understood.

---

## 3. Terminology

- **OBI**: an OpenBindings interface document.
- **Core**: this specification, as distinct from what particular kinds define.
- **Tool**: any software that acts on OBI documents ([§10.1](#101-tool-obligations)).
- **Processor**: a tool that takes an OBI document as input ([§10.1](#101-tool-obligations)).
- **Validator**: a processor that checks a document against the document rules ([§10.2](#102-document-rules)) and reports what it established ([§10.4](#104-conformance-conclusions)).
- **Operation**: a named, protocol-independent capability contract under a key in `operations`: what a service can do, as a name with optional per-value input and output schemas ([§5.1](#51-operations)). Unqualified, *contract* means this whole contract.
- **Value contract**: the part of an operation's contract that governs each caller-facing value crossing the boundary in one direction, to the operation or from it, stated by a schema: the **input contract**, stated by `input`, or the **output contract**, stated by `output`. An absent field states none ([§5.1](#51-operations)).
- **Alias**: an additional name under which an operation is recognized, equal in standing to its key ([§5.1](#51-operations)).
- **Correspondence**: an operation that carries a published name as its key or an alias **claims correspondence with** the operation that name identifies, read against the shared contract a consumer holds; the claim is the author's alone ([§5.1](#51-operations)).
- **Shared contract**: a published set of operations offered for adoption, such as another OBI's, not one operation's contract; its operations' keys and aliases are published names ([§5.1](#51-operations)).
- **Caller-facing**: on the operation's side of a binding: the values a caller sends to and receives from the operation, which its value contracts govern where stated ([§5](#5-document-model)).
- **Context**: what a realization needs that the operation is not about, such as a credential or a target's address; the kind or tool policy supplies it ([§5](#5-document-model)).
- **Author claim**: one of the claims [§5](#5-document-model) lists, which a document makes and no document rule checks.
- **Binding**: an author-declared realization of an operation through a source, under a key in `bindings` ([§5.3](#53-bindings)).
- **Realization**: a concrete way of carrying out an operation's contract through a target. A binding declares one ([§5.3](#53-bindings)) and a dependency consumes one supplied from elsewhere ([§5.5](#55-dependencies)), each as an author claim.
- **Target**: what a binding is intended to act on under its source's kind: an entry in an artifact, a member of a live surface such as a running service's tool listing, or another form ([§5.4](#54-sources)).
- **Interaction**: the exchange with a target that acting on a binding involves, such as a request and response, a stream, or a subscription; its mechanics are read under the source's kind ([§6](#6-kinds)).
- **Source**: an object carrying a kind and optional content read under that kind, under a key in `sources` ([§5.4](#54-sources)).
- **Source artifact**: a concrete representation an interpretation of a source may use, such as an OpenAPI document, a `.proto` source, an operation graph, or an MCP endpoint's tool listing, carried in or referenced from source `content`, or obtained otherwise ([§5.4](#54-sources)).
- **Kind**: the exact, opaque, non-empty string a source carries in `kind` and a dependency may list in `kinds`; it selects how a source and its bindings are read ([§6](#6-kinds)).
- **Dependency**: a named point where the described component consumes a realization of an operation, optionally limited to declared kinds, under a key in `dependencies` ([§5.5](#55-dependencies)).
- **OBI position**: a place where the document model puts a schema; the **schemas the document contains** extend these through the resources declared there, nested resources included ([§7](#7-reference-resolution) defines both).
- **Document resource**: the schema resource every schema at an OBI position that declares no `$id` belongs to; a schema that declares `$id` begins a resource of its own ([§7.2](#72-the-document-as-embedding)).
- **Field**: a property of an OBI-defined object (the document root, and operation, dependency, source, binding, and example objects). Keys inside the document's maps and property names inside JSON Schema objects are not fields ([§12](#12-extensions)).
- **Absolute URI**: a URI with a scheme (RFC 3986 §3), fragment permitted; not RFC 3986's `absolute-URI` production, which excludes fragments.

## 4. Overview (informative)

OpenBindings separates capability contracts (operations with per-value schemas) from declared realizations (bindings through sources) and named consumption points (dependencies): a single OBI can bind an operation over multiple protocols, depend on an operation, or do both without redefining the contract. Terms used informally below are defined in [Terminology].

Every OBI declares a specification version and an operations map; the minimal conformant document is just those two fields:

```json
{
  "openbindings": "0.2.0",
  "operations": {}
}
```

An operation is the contract, a source carries the kind under which it and its bindings are read, and a binding links the two; one contract with many bindings is the specification's primary abstraction. This fuller OBI binds `createTask` over two protocols, shares a schema between operations, describes an error shape beside a result, adapts a source's wire shape in binding content, and claims correspondence through a qualified alias (a consumer holding a shared contract that publishes `createTask` may read its key the same way):

```json
{
  "openbindings": "0.2.0",
  "name": "Task Manager",
  "schemas": {
    "Task": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "id": { "type": "string" },
        "title": { "type": "string" },
        "done": { "type": "boolean" }
      },
      "required": ["id", "title"]
    },
    "Problem": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": { "problem": { "type": "string" } },
      "required": ["problem"],
      "additionalProperties": false
    }
  },
  "operations": {
    "createTask": {
      "description": "Create a new task.",
      "aliases": ["acme.tasks.createTask"],
      "input": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": { "title": { "type": "string" } },
        "required": ["title"]
      },
      "output": {
        "anyOf": [{ "$ref": "#/schemas/Task" }, { "$ref": "#/schemas/Problem" }]
      }
    },
    "listTasks": {
      "description": "List all tasks.",
      "input": { "type": "object", "maxProperties": 0 },
      "output": {
        "anyOf": [
          { "type": "array", "items": { "$ref": "#/schemas/Task" } },
          { "$ref": "#/schemas/Problem" }
        ]
      }
    }
  },
  "sources": {
    "httpApi": {
      "kind": "example.openapi@1",
      "content": { "location": "https://example.com/openapi.json" }
    },
    "mcpServer": {
      "kind": "example.mcp@1",
      "content": { "location": "https://example.com/mcp" }
    }
  },
  "bindings": {
    "createTask.http": {
      "operation": "createTask",
      "source": "httpApi",
      "content": {
        "target": "#/paths/~1tasks/post",
        "outputTransform": "{ \"id\": task_id, \"title\": task_title, \"done\": is_done }"
      }
    },
    "createTask.mcp": {
      "operation": "createTask",
      "source": "mcpServer",
      "content": { "target": "tools/create_task" }
    },
    "listTasks.http": {
      "operation": "listTasks",
      "source": "httpApi",
      "content": {
        "target": "#/paths/~1tasks/get",
        "outputTransform": "[$.{ \"id\": task_id, \"title\": task_title, \"done\": is_done }]"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Here `target` and `outputTransform` illustrate one possible reading of `example.openapi@1` ([§5.3](#53-bindings)), under which each HTTP binding's transform applies to success responses and an error response's body passes through as a `Problem` value.

An operation's presence alone declares a contract, not availability: a binding declares a realization of it through a source, and a dependency declares a named consumption point for which a realization may be supplied through composition:

```json
{
  "openbindings": "0.2.0",
  "operations": {
    "events.deliver": {
      "aliases": ["acme.events.deliver"],
      "input": { "type": "object" },
      "output": { "type": "object", "maxProperties": 0 }
    }
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "customerDelivery": {
      "operation": "events.deliver",
      "kinds": [
        "example.openapi@1",
        "example.grpc@1"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The alias adopts a published name, so a tool composing the component can look for a provider whose operation carries the same name; how it finds and judges one is its own ([§1.2](#12-out-of-scope)).

## 5. Document model

An OBI document is a JSON object. Top-level fields:

| Field          | Type   | Required | Purpose                                                                                                                            |
| -------------- | ------ | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `openbindings` | string | yes      | Specification version the document declares (SemVer).                                                                              |
| `name`         | string | no       | Human-friendly label. Not an identifier.                                                                                           |
| `version`      | string | no       | Interface-version label, opaque to this specification ([§8.2](#82-version-field-interface-version-label)). Non-empty when present. |
| `description`  | string | no       | Human-friendly description.                                                                                                        |
| `schemas`      | object | no       | Map of schema names to JSON Schemas.                                                                                               |
| `operations`   | object | yes      | Map of operation keys to operation objects.                                                                                        |
| `dependencies` | object | no       | Map of dependency keys to dependency objects.                                                                                      |
| `sources`      | object | no       | Map of source keys to source objects.                                                                                              |
| `bindings`     | object | no       | Map of binding keys to binding objects.                                                                                            |

**Names.** The map keys this specification defines (operation, dependency, binding, source, schema, and example keys) and operation aliases are names: opaque ASCII tokens matching `^[A-Za-z0-9_][A-Za-z0-9_.-]*$`, an [ECMA-262](#131-normative-references) pattern matched against the whole name, so a trailing newline fails it ([OBI-D-03](#102-document-rules)). Names are equal only as exact strings, case included, and every rule compares them so. Dots and hyphens carry no structure: a dot may qualify a shared name by convention ([§5.1](#51-operations)), but nothing in this specification parses the segments. A name shaped like a URI, a path, or a programming-language identifier is only a name, which is why the grammar admits a leading digit (`2fa.verify`); code generators apply their own deterministic naming policy. Keys within one map are distinct ([OBI-D-01](#102-document-rules)).

**Value representation.** Operation inputs and outputs are described in the JSON data model of [RFC 8259](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8259): a caller-facing value is one JSON value crossing the operation boundary (invariant 1). Which interaction data forms one value, and how it corresponds to JSON, is read under the source's kind: an array returned in one HTTP response can be one value, the items of a gRPC stream several. A tool chooses its own data types and need not materialize JSON text.

**Context.** Caller-facing values are the ones the operation is about. Anything else a realization needs, such as a credential, the address of a target, or a deadline, is **context**, which the kind or tool policy supplies. A credential is caller-facing only when the operation is about it, which the author decides by describing it in `input` or `output`, where those are present.

**Fields and extensions.** Each OBI-defined object carries only the fields its table lists and extension fields whose names begin with `x-` ([OBI-D-02](#102-document-rules), [§12](#12-extensions)).

**Presence.** For every optional member, presence is distinct from value: a member present with the JSON value `null` is present, and only omitting the member omits it. Tools therefore track presence rather than testing for nullish values ([OBI-T-02](#103-tool-rules)).

**Author claims.** Some of what a document says is its author's claim: an operation's `examples` ([§5.1](#51-operations)), a binding's claim to realize its operation and the binding's `idempotent` ([§5.3](#53-bindings)), a dependency's claim to consume its operation within its value contracts ([§5.5](#55-dependencies)), and correspondence ([§5.1](#51-operations)). This specification defines what each asserts; whether it is true is outside document conformance ([OBI-T-10](#103-tool-rules)), and a tool decides for itself whether to rely on it.

### 5.1. Operations

An operation's name and its optional schemas for each caller-facing input and output value ([§3](#3-terminology)) are its whole signature. Interaction pattern and cardinality (request/response, streaming, bidirectional, pub/sub; how many values cross) belong to each binding under its source's kind (invariant 1), which keeps the operation binding-independent. An operation stands on its own: the document may bind it, depend on it, do both, or neither ([§5.5](#55-dependencies)), and its declaration alone makes no claim that a realization is available.

`output` describes every value the operation returns, whatever it means to the caller (several event types, a union of representations, a result or an error); any JSON Schema construct can express the variation, such as `oneOf`, `anyOf`, or a `type` array. Which results of an interaction a binding returns as output values is read under its source's kind.

An operation object's members are all optional:

| Field         | Type                  | Purpose                                                            |
| ------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `description` | string                | Human-readable description of the capability, which bindings claim to carry out ([§5.3](#53-bindings)). |
| `deprecated`  | boolean               | Hint that consumers should migrate away from the operation.        |
| `tags`        | array of strings      | Documentation labels for grouping/filtering.                       |
| `aliases`     | array of strings      | Additional names, equal in standing to the operation's key.        |
| `input`       | JSON Schema or absent | States the input contract, which governs each caller-facing input value. |
| `output`      | JSON Schema or absent | States the output contract, which governs each caller-facing output value. |
| `examples`    | object                | Map of example names to example objects; see below.                |

**Schema states.** `input` and `output`, when present, hold a JSON Schema 2020-12 object or boolean schema ([§5.2](#52-schemas)); omission is the only way to state no value contract, and literal `null` is not valid at either position. The states are distinct:

| Form               | Meaning                                                                 |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| field absent       | No value contract is stated for that direction.                         |
| `{}` or `true`     | A value contract is stated; every JSON value satisfies it.              |
| `false`            | A value contract is stated; no JSON value satisfies it.                 |
| `{"type": "null"}` | A value contract is stated; only the JSON value `null` satisfies it.    |

Absence claims nothing portable in that direction: neither that the interaction carries no values nor that every value satisfies it. `false` states a value contract that admits no value: under `output: false` a binding whose claim holds returns none. Under `input: false` a caller has no value it can send within the input contract, so a binding that delivers no caller-facing input values can realize it. How many values cross remains each binding's (invariant 1); the core has no cardinality field.

For an operation that takes no meaningful input, the recommended schema admits only the empty object: `{"type": "object", "maxProperties": 0}`. Kinds differ on whether such a call carries an empty value (an MCP tool's `{}` arguments, a gRPC `Empty` message) or no value at all, and this input contract suits both: the empty value satisfies it, and where no value crosses there is nothing to validate. Omitting `input` would state no input contract, and `false` leaves a caller that must send `{}` nothing it may send. An operation that returns nothing meaningful on any outcome, error or otherwise, uses the same schema for `output`; `output: false` would misdescribe one realized under a kind that surfaces an empty result as `{}`.

**Signature.** `input` describes the values the operation takes and `output` the values it returns. Like a function signature, the two describe shape, not behavior: a caller that sends a value `input` describes is using the operation as described, but the schemas alone establish neither which such values a realization succeeds on nor that one is available at all. A caller relies on a realization's values matching `output` exactly as far as it trusts the binding's author claim ([§5.3](#53-bindings)).

**Aliases.** An operation's **identifiers** are its key and its aliases, one flat, document-unique namespace in which every identifier resolves the operation equally ([OBI-D-04](#102-document-rules), [OBI-T-07](#103-tool-rules)). The key is the primary name, used for display, logging, and the `operation` references bindings and dependencies carry; beyond that, choosing a key or an alias carries no meaning. Aliases commonly keep a prior name after a rename, carry a vendor-specific name some consumers look up by, or adopt a shared contract's operation name.

**Correspondence.** A **shared contract** is any published set of operations offered for adoption, such as another OBI's; the keys and aliases of its operations are **published names**. By carrying a published name as its key or an alias, an operation **claims correspondence with** the operation that name identifies: a consumer holding a shared contract that publishes the name may read the operation as asserting that it is that contract's operation. The claim is an author claim ([§5](#5-document-model)) made by carrying the name, whatever the author intended, and it is read against the shared contract the consumer holds, never against every contract that publishes the name. The document names no shared contract or version, and the claim demonstrates no schema compatibility, behavioral equivalence, substitutability, ownership, or trust; no rule verifies it. A consumer that requires compatibility compares the operation against a reference OBI of its choosing, under its own policy.

**Publishing names (informative).** Two adopted names that collide cannot coexist in one document; publishers of names intended for adoption avoid this, and keep claims intentional, by qualifying them under a namespace they control with enough interface scope (`acme.tasks.createTask` rather than `create`). A published name stays useful for correspondence while it names one continuing semantic operation, so an intentionally incompatible replacement is best given a new name. Both are conventions, not conformance requirements.

**Examples.** `examples` maps names to author-supplied samples. An example object's members are all optional:

| Field         | Type           | Purpose                              |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `description` | string         | Human-readable description.          |
| `input`       | any JSON value | One caller-facing input value.       |
| `output`      | any JSON value | One caller-facing output value.      |

Examples are **positive** author claims ([§5](#5-document-model)): the author asserts that each provided value validates against the corresponding operation schema, where that schema is present. A tool that checks the claim evaluates the value as any other ([§5.2](#52-schemas)), and a mismatch is a false claim, never an exception to the schema ([OBI-T-11](#103-tool-rules)). Example members are values, not schemas, so an explicitly `null` member supplies the JSON value `null` ([§5](#5-document-model), Presence), covered like any other, and an operation whose `output` is `{"type": "null"}` can carry an example. Examples claim schema membership only: no binding is selected or acted on, and an input paired with an output does not establish that the output can result from the input.

### 5.2. Schemas

The top-level `schemas` map holds named JSON Schemas, which operations reference with `$ref` (for example, `{"$ref": "#/schemas/Task"}`).

Every schema the document contains ([§3](#3-terminology)) is a [JSON Schema 2020-12](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12) schema in object or boolean form, valid against the 2020-12 meta-schemas ([OBI-D-10](#102-document-rules)); an invalid schema at a schema position, such as `{"type": 42}`, violates that rule.

**Dialect.** Each schema the document contains is read under its resource's dialect. The document resource's dialect is 2020-12; a `$schema` in it declares none. A resource an `$id` declares takes the dialect its `$schema` names, or without one that of its enclosing resource, which for a schema at an OBI position is the document resource (JSON Schema Core §9.3.2). A `$schema` other than 2020-12 violates [OBI-D-06](#102-document-rules); a tool that still evaluates follows [OBI-T-08](#103-tool-rules) under that dialect and gives no verdict where it lacks it. JSON Schema permits `$schema` only at a resource root (JSON Schema Core §8.1.1), which in an OBI is a schema that declares `$id`, the only resource root in an OBI that is itself a schema ([§7.2](#72-the-document-as-embedding)), so authors write it only there and remove it from a pasted schema that declares no `$id`; misplacement is JSON Schema's to report, not a document rule. A schema reached through an external URI follows the dialect JSON Schema assigns it, implementation-defined when its root declares no `$schema` (JSON Schema Core §8.1.1).

Beyond this section and the reference forms of [§7](#7-reference-resolution), JSON Schema 2020-12 governs the document's schemas: their meaning, reference resolution, and value evaluation. This specification defines no keyword and no evaluation of its own. Besides OBI-D-01 and OBI-D-02, which read the whole document, only OBI-D-05, OBI-D-06, OBI-D-10, OBI-D-12, and OBI-D-13 test schemas ([§7.5](#75-notes-for-authors-and-tools-informative) tabulates what each walks). JSON Schema's other requirements, and conditions that arise at evaluation, such as an unobtainable external reference or a regular expression an engine cannot compile, surface when a tool uses the schema and are not document-rule violations.

**Validation semantics.** A tool that claims to check values against an operation's value contracts follows [OBI-T-08](#103-tool-rules) under the dialect assigned above, and one that claims to derive another form from a schema follows [OBI-T-05](#103-tool-rules); a tool that only preserves schemas through round-trips need not interpret them.

**Schemas from other dialects (informative).** A copied schema is read under the dialect assigned by the preceding paragraph. In the document resource, that dialect is 2020-12, even if a misplaced `$schema` names another dialect. A resource root can declare its dialect with `$schema`; otherwise it inherits its enclosing resource's dialect. Any `$schema` naming another dialect violates OBI-D-06. Under a 2020-12 reading, OpenAPI 3.0's `nullable: true` is an unknown keyword, which JSON Schema ignores, so `{"type": "string", "nullable": true}` rejects a `null` the service returns, and draft-07's array form of `items` violates OBI-D-10. Translating such schemas to 2020-12 when bringing them in keeps their meaning.

### 5.3. Bindings

A binding object has these members ([OBI-D-02](#102-document-rules)):

| Field         | Type           | Required | Purpose                                                                   |
| ------------- | -------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `operation`   | string         | yes      | Key into the document's `operations` map.                                 |
| `source`      | string         | yes      | Key into the document's `sources` map.                                    |
| `content`     | any JSON value | no       | Content read under the source's kind.                                     |
| `idempotent`  | boolean        | no       | Author claim about repeating the operation through this binding; see below. |
| `preference`  | integer        | no       | Author preference signal among bindings of the same operation; see below. |
| `description` | string         | no       | Human-readable description.                                               |
| `deprecated`  | boolean        | no       | Author recommends migration away from this binding.                       |

A binding's `content` might identify the target that realizes the operation, describe how values are adapted between the operation's value contracts and that target, or serve any other purpose its source's kind gives it. A JSON Pointer into an OpenAPI document, a fully qualified gRPC method name with a value mapping, and an MCP tool name are examples. Its presence, absence, type, and members carry no core meaning.

**Realizations.** Multiple bindings MAY reference the same operation, each an author-declared realization of it. Attaching a binding asserts, as an author claim ([§5](#5-document-model)), that its target realizes the operation as the document describes it:

- it takes any value `input` describes as the operation's input (a caller may send it), though it need not succeed on each, and returns only values `output` describes, each half where the operation states the corresponding value contract ([§5.1](#51-operations));
- it carries out the operation its description conveys (the capability, not the wording) and its identifiers name, correspondence claims included, as a consumer reads them ([§5.1](#51-operations)).

The operation's tags, deprecation, and examples are not part of the claim. No rule verifies it, and no document can show that the target is available or works. Each binding claims to realize the operation on its own; beyond what the document describes, OpenBindings establishes no semantic equivalence or mechanical interchangeability among realizations (invariant 1), so a caller that needs a particular interaction pattern chooses among bindings accordingly.

**Idempotency.** `idempotent: true` is the binding author's claim ([§5](#5-document-model)) that repeating the operation through this binding with the same input, in [context](#3-terminology) that differs at most in ways the operation's effects do not depend on (a later deadline, say), produces no additional intended operation-level effects after the first application. `idempotent: false` claims that some valid repetition through it can produce additional intended effects, and absence claims neither. Bindings of one operation may differ: a binding that deduplicates retried requests can claim `true` beside one that does not. The claim concerns intended operation-level effects, not returned values, timing, or other per-attempt observations: a read of changing state can be idempotent while returning different values, and so can a deletion whose later attempts report absence. It implies neither that the operation, through this binding or any other, is safe, read-only, deterministic, cacheable, or harmless, nor that authorization, billing, or audit effects repeat without consequence. Alone, it neither authorizes switching bindings between attempts nor yields retry safety, though an invocation policy may consider it.

**One contract, several bindings (informative).** Because every binding claims the same contract, `input` describes values every binding carrying input takes, and `output` covers every value any binding returns. Callers that must tell output values apart, such as a result from an error, rely on the schema (a required property, say), since no core field marks one. Where bindings' values do not share a per-value shape (an HTTP binding returning a list as one array value, a streaming binding returning items one at a time), `output` describes both shapes, a kind's value adaptation reconciles them, or they realize different operations.

**Preference signals.** `preference` is an optional signed integer from -9007199254740991 through 9007199254740991 (the exactly representable interoperable range); an integer is a number with no fractional part, so `1.0` and `1` are the same preference. Among bindings of the same operation that declare it, a higher value expresses stronger author preference and equal values no order. Omission states no preference, not zero or any other value, and zero and negative values mean nothing beyond their numeric order. `deprecated: true` states that the author recommends migration away from the binding and ordinarily does not recommend it for new use; it neither removes the binding nor changes what it declares. The two signals are independent dimensions (lifecycle guidance, relative choice) with no mandated order between them. Whether and how they shape binding selection is up to tools ([§1.2](#12-out-of-scope)), and explicit caller choice and tool policy may override both.

### 5.4. Sources

A source object has these members ([OBI-D-02](#102-document-rules)):

| Field         | Type           | Required | Purpose                               |
| ------------- | -------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `kind`        | string         | yes      | The source's kind, a non-empty string ([§6](#6-kinds)). |
| `content`     | any JSON value | no       | Content read under the source's kind. |
| `description` | string         | no       | Human-readable description.           |

The content can embed an artifact, address one or a live service, name something a processor's environment provides, or combine these; since JSON has no binary primitive, how a binary artifact is encoded there is read under the kind ([§6](#6-kinds)).

**Target identity.** How a binding's target is identified is read under the source's kind: from the binding and source alone, or with configuration, runtime naming, or other state.

### 5.5. Dependencies

A dependency's map key identifies its consumption point ([§3](#3-terminology)) for configuration, wiring, and diagnostics; the dependency names no provider, creates no operation, and does not enter the operation-identifier namespace.

A dependency object has these members ([OBI-D-02](#102-document-rules)):

| Field         | Type             | Required | Purpose                                     |
| ------------- | ---------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `operation`   | string           | yes      | Key into the document's `operations` map.   |
| `kinds`       | array of strings | no       | Kinds acceptable at this consumption point. |
| `description` | string           | no       | Human-readable description.                 |

**Consumption.** Declaring a dependency asserts, as an author claim ([§5](#5-document-model)), that the described component, as a caller of the operation, sends only values `input` describes and takes any value `output` describes, error-shaped values included, as the operation's output. Each half applies where the operation states the corresponding value contract.

When present, `kinds` holds one or more unique kinds ([§6](#6-kinds), [OBI-D-02](#102-document-rules)), in no meaningful order, as an **any-of constraint**: a binding considered for the dependency meets it if and only if its referenced source's `kind` exactly equals at least one listed kind. Without `kinds`, the dependency declares no kind constraint. `kinds`, present or absent, says nothing about processor support ([OBI-T-01](#103-tool-rules)). The kind test is only one constraint: a tool's composition decides which bindings are candidates, including whether this document's own bindings for the operation are ([§1.2](#12-out-of-scope)).

Multiple dependencies MAY reference the same operation, including with different `kinds` constraints, and an operation MAY have both bindings and dependencies, each dependency a separate consumption point.

When the consuming behavior runs and what happens when no realization is supplied (startup requirements, feature availability, conditional use, readiness, and failure behavior) are application and deployment policy. An unsatisfied dependency neither makes the OBI non-conformant nor by itself shows the described component unavailable or unhealthy.

---

## 6. Kinds

A source's `kind` ([§3](#3-terminology)) names how the source and its bindings are read; a dependency may list the kinds it accepts in `kinds` ([§5.5](#55-dependencies)).

**Comparison.** Kinds are compared as whole strings by exact equality ([OBI-T-01](#103-tool-rules)): two different strings are two unrelated kinds.

**Interpretation.** Supporting a kind means knowing how to read the `content` of its sources and their bindings for whatever work a tool does with them. That knowledge may be built in, supplied by a plugin, or configured locally, written down or only in code; a tool may preserve, index, or display a source whose kind it does not support, and the document conforms regardless ([OBI-T-01](#103-tool-rules)).

**What a kind decides.** The core leaves to a source's kind:

- what a source's `content` and its bindings' `content` may contain, and what they mean ([§5.3](#53-bindings), [§5.4](#54-sources));
- how a binding's target is identified ([§5.4](#54-sources));
- how caller-facing values correspond to interaction data: value adaptation, which data forms one value, and which results of an interaction are returned as output values ([§5](#5-document-model), [§5.1](#51-operations));
- interaction mechanics: pattern, cardinality, framing, completion, and lifecycle (invariant 1);
- how a binary artifact is encoded in `content` ([§5.4](#54-sources));
- what context a realization requires, such as credentials, where a tool's policy does not supply it ([§5](#5-document-model)).

A kind in turn stands on these core provisions, whose changes [§8.1](#81-openbindings-field-specification-version) records as breaking:

- a kind is an exact, opaque string, compared whole ([OBI-T-01](#103-tool-rules));
- `content` is any JSON value, and its presence is distinct from its value ([§5](#5-document-model));
- `content` is exempt from the reference rules of [§7](#7-reference-resolution);
- caller-facing values are JSON values, and an operation's schemas apply to each value (invariant 1);
- a binding claims that its target realizes its operation as the document describes it, taking any value `input` describes, without promising success on each, and returning only values `output` describes, each where the operation states the corresponding value contract ([§5.3](#53-bindings)).

**Sharing a kind.** A kind is portable as far as its meaning is shared. Authors who want independent tools to agree on one describe it in writing and, since a document offers tools no way to tell two meanings of one kind apart, give an incompatible meaning a new kind. A kind meant to circulate widely can be qualified under a name its publisher controls. These are interoperability practices, not conformance requirements. This project's published kind definitions ([§14](#14-see-also)) have no special standing here, and matching a kind establishes neither provenance nor authorization ([§9](#9-security-considerations)).

A locally built CLI consuming a private artifact might use:

```json
{
  "kind": "my-cli.usage@1",
  "content": { "location": "file:///home/user/project/usage.kdl" }
}
```

---

## 7. Reference resolution

OBI documents define no `id` field. A document's base URI is its own ([§7.2](#72-the-document-as-embedding)), so its OBI-defined references resolve identically however it was obtained (invariant 4).

**OBI positions.** An **OBI position** is a place where the document model puts a schema: an operation's `input` or `output`, an entry in the `schemas` map, and every subschema reached from one of these through the keywords the JSON Schema 2020-12 meta-schema validates as schemas (`$defs`, `properties`, `patternProperties`, `dependentSchemas`, `additionalProperties`, `propertyNames`, `items`, `prefixItems`, `contains`, `allOf`, `anyOf`, `oneOf`, `not`, `if`, `then`, `else`, `unevaluatedItems`, `unevaluatedProperties`, and `contentSchema`, with the legacy `definitions` and the schema values of the legacy `dependencies`; JSON Schema Validation, Appendix A). The walk does not enter a schema that declares `$id` (has an `$id` member): that schema is itself at an OBI position, but everything in the resource it declares, its own keywords other than `$id` included, belongs to that resource ([§7.2](#72-the-document-as-embedding)). The **schemas the document contains** are the schemas at OBI positions and every subschema reached from those that declare `$id` through the same keywords, entering nested schemas that declare `$id` as well; nothing else in the document is a schema it contains. In [§7](#7-reference-resolution) and the document rules, a schema at an OBI position, or a schema the document contains, is any JSON object or boolean there, whether or not it is valid against the meta-schemas. Any other value there is not a schema: the walks do not enter it and [OBI-D-12](#102-document-rules) rejects it as a target. [OBI-D-10](#102-document-rules) judges each operation `input` and `output` and each `schemas` entry, whatever its type.

### 7.1. Reference forms

The **OBI-defined document references** are the `$ref` and `$dynamicRef` keywords in the [document resource](#3-terminology). [OBI-D-05](#102-document-rules) fixes their form, and that of each schema `$id` at an OBI position: an [absolute URI](#3-terminology), or for a reference a same-document reference (empty, or a fragment alone; RFC 3986 §4.4), all well-formed URI-references (RFC 3986 §4.1). A string that is not a well-formed URI-reference is not a reference of any form: OBI-D-05 reports it, [OBI-D-12](#102-document-rules) does not govern it, and a value whose evaluation depends on it has an undefined result ([OBI-T-08](#103-tool-rules)).

### 7.2. The document as embedding

JSON Schema lets the format that embeds a schema determine its initial base URI (JSON Schema Core §9.1.1) and leaves open how such schemas fit its resource model (JSON Schema Core §4.3.5). OBI settles both:

- The document is its schemas' embedding document, with a base URI unique to it and drawn from nowhere else (RFC 3986 §5.1.4). In the document resource, a same-document reference is initially resolved exactly as [OBI-D-12](#102-document-rules) looks it up, with dynamic resolution then following JSON Schema ([§7.4](#74-other-references)). An empty reference or empty fragment, such as `#`, names the OBI document itself, not the schema that contains it. A non-empty fragment is percent-decoded first: one that then begins with `/`, such as that of `#/schemas/Task`, is a JSON Pointer, evaluated per [RFC 6901](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6901) §4 from the document root, and any other is a plain name.
- The schemas at OBI positions that declare no `$id` are subschemas of one schema resource, the **document resource**; the plain names they declare with `$anchor` or `$dynamicAnchor` belong to it. A same-document plain-name reference in it resolves to the schema that declares the name, and an evaluation that begins at one of those schemas begins in it, making the document resource the outermost in the evaluation's dynamic scope.
- A schema that declares `$id` begins a resource of its own, as does a schema nested in it that declares `$id`. The references, anchors, and nested `$id`s within it, including its own keywords other than `$id`, take any form JSON Schema allows and resolve against its base.

### 7.3. Same-document references

[OBI-D-12](#102-document-rules) decides each same-document reference in the document resource by a lookup in the document, not by evaluation. A JSON Pointer fails when it is not a valid RFC 6901 pointer, or reaches no location or a location holding no schema (an operation object, a map, a string, `x-` data, a source's or binding's `content`, an example value). It also fails when it reaches inside a schema that declares `$id`, whose contents are reached through that `$id`. A plain name fails unless a schema in the document resource declares it ([§7.2](#72-the-document-as-embedding)). An `$anchor` or `$dynamicAnchor` declares a plain name only when its value is a string matching, as a whole, the grammar of JSON Schema Core §8.2.2. Any other value declares no name for OBI-D-12, [OBI-D-13](#102-document-rules), or the resolution [§7.2](#72-the-document-as-embedding) bases on OBI-D-12; [OBI-D-10](#102-document-rules) reports it. [§7.5](#75-notes-for-authors-and-tools-informative) tabulates examples.

### 7.4. Other references

Beyond these lookups, references resolve as JSON Schema 2020-12 defines: dynamic references, references within a schema resource that declares `$id` (its plain names included), and references to external schemas. Because [OBI-D-13](#102-document-rules) normalizes an `$id` only by RFC 3986 §5.2 resolution (which removes dot segments) and empty-fragment removal, spellings a URI library would merge stay distinct under it; whether they collide in use is JSON Schema's. Where JSON Schema leaves a result undefined, the reference's meaning in an OBI is undefined too (an undefined result, [OBI-T-08](#103-tool-rules)), though the document conforms: within a schema resource that declares `$id`, a pointer that reaches no schema or a plain name declared twice (JSON Schema Core §9.4.2, §8.2.2).

A tool MAY decline to obtain external resources. A document whose schema references all resolve within it needs no network access to resolve them, and declining a resource needed to evaluate a particular value prevents a validation verdict for that value ([OBI-T-08](#103-tool-rules)) but never affects document conformance ([§10.4](#104-conformance-conclusions)). Schema reference cycles are permitted ([OBI-T-06](#103-tool-rules)): recursive types (trees, linked lists, ASTs) are legitimate and widespread. A cycle that recurses without consuming any of the instance, such as a schema whose only keyword is a `$ref` to itself, has undefined behavior under JSON Schema (JSON Schema Core §9.4.1).

### 7.5. Notes for authors and tools (informative)

Which schemas each document rule walks:

| Rule | What it walks | At a schema that declares `$id` |
| ---- | ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| OBI-D-05 | `$ref` and `$dynamicRef` in the document resource; `$id` at OBI positions | Checks that schema's `$id`; its other keywords and contents belong to its resource |
| OBI-D-06 | `$schema` in every schema the document contains | Continues inside the resource |
| OBI-D-10 | Each operation `input`/`output` and `schemas` entry, with its subschemas, against the meta-schemas | Continues inside the resource |
| OBI-D-12 | Same-document references in the document resource | Skips that schema's own references; a pointer may land on it, not inside it, and a plain name declared inside it does not count |
| OBI-D-13 | Plain names in the document resource; `$id` in every schema the document contains | Plain names inside it belong to its resource |

**Same-document references (example).** Given this document:

```json
{
  "openbindings": "0.2.0",
  "schemas": {
    "Task": {
      "$anchor": "task",
      "type": "object",
      "properties": { "my type": { "type": "string" } }
    },
    "Tree": {
      "$id": "https://example.com/schemas/tree.json",
      "$anchor": "tree",
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "children": { "type": "array", "items": { "$ref": "#" } }
      }
    }
  },
  "operations": {}
}
```

each reference below, written in the document resource (as the `$ref` of an operation added to it, `{"output": {"$ref": "…"}}`), has the outcome shown:

| Reference | Read as | Outcome |
| --------- | ------- | ------- |
| `#` or the empty reference | The OBI document itself | Fails OBI-D-12: an empty reference or fragment never qualifies |
| `#/schemas/Task` | A pointer to `Task` | Holds |
| `#/schemas/Task/properties/my%20type` | A pointer, decoded to `/schemas/Task/properties/my type` | Holds |
| `#/schemas/Task/properties/my type` | Not a well-formed URI-reference | Fails OBI-D-05 |
| `#/schemas/Task/properties/my%2520type` | Decoded once, to `/schemas/Task/properties/my%20type`, which reaches nothing | Fails OBI-D-12 |
| `#%2Fschemas%2FTask` | Decoded to `/schemas/Task`, a pointer | Holds |
| `#/schemas/Task/type` | A pointer to the string `"object"` | Fails OBI-D-12: not a schema |
| `#/operations` | A pointer to a map | Fails OBI-D-12: not a schema |
| `#/schemas/Missing` | A pointer that reaches nothing | Fails OBI-D-12 |
| `#/schemas/~2` | Not a valid JSON Pointer (`~2` is no escape) | Fails OBI-D-12 |
| `#/schemas/Tree` | A pointer landing on `Tree`, which declares `$id` | Holds (JSON Schema Core §9.2.1 prefers the `$id` form) |
| `#/schemas/Tree/properties/children` | A pointer into Tree's resource | Fails OBI-D-12: reach it through the `$id` |
| `#task` | A plain name declared in the document resource | Holds |
| `#t%61sk` | Decoded to the plain name `task` | Holds |
| `#tree` | A plain name declared only inside Tree's resource | Fails OBI-D-12 |
| `#%FF` | A fragment that does not decode to UTF-8 | Fails OBI-D-12 |
| `tree.json#/properties/children` | A relative reference that is not same-document | Fails OBI-D-05 |
| `https://example.com/schemas/tree.json#/properties/children` | An absolute URI | Outside OBI-D-12; JSON Schema resolves it |

The `{"$ref": "#"}` inside `Tree` resolves against Tree's `$id`, names `Tree` itself, and is outside OBI-D-12.

Schemas pasted in from standalone files are the usual source of mistakes. Such a schema often recurses with `{"$ref": "#"}` or points into its own `$defs` with `#/$defs/Node`; embedded without an `$id`, both resolve from the OBI document root (the first names the OBI document, the second a location that does not exist) and violate OBI-D-12. There are two remedies:

- Rewrite the pointers to the schema's place in the document (`#/schemas/Tree`, `#/schemas/Tree/$defs/Node`). A property name that needs encoding, such as `my type`, is written percent-encoded (`#/schemas/Tree/$defs/my%20type`), as OBI-D-05 requires of a URI-reference, and OBI-D-12 decodes it.
- Give the embedded schema an absolute `$id`, which keeps its internal references working as they did standalone, resolved as JSON Schema defines (pointers per RFC 6901 §6). The `$id` also moves those references outside OBI-D-12, so a pointer inside it that reaches nothing is no longer caught.

The second remedy looks like this:

```json
{
  "openbindings": "0.2.0",
  "schemas": {
    "Tree": {
      "$id": "https://example.com/schemas/tree.json",
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "children": { "type": "array", "items": { "$ref": "#" } }
      }
    }
  },
  "operations": {
    "getTree": {
      "input": { "type": "object", "maxProperties": 0 },
      "output": { "$ref": "https://example.com/schemas/tree.json" }
    }
  }
}
```

Inside `Tree`, `#` resolves against its `$id` and names `Tree` itself, and an `$anchor` declared there belongs to Tree's resource, not the document resource. The operation reaches `Tree` through its `$id`.

Addressing works in one direction: a schema with its own `$id` cannot address by URI the schemas that belong to the document resource, since the document's base URI is drawn from nowhere a reference can name ([§7.2](#72-the-document-as-embedding)). Any shared schema it references must therefore be reachable through an identified resource: its own `$id`, or a pointer or anchor within a resource that has one. The same holds across documents: `$id` is the portable handle for a schema meant to be referenced from elsewhere. A reference into a document that is not a schema, such as `#/components/schemas/Task` in an OpenAPI document or `#/schemas/Task` in another OBI, lands in a structure JSON Schema does not recognize, where its behavior is undefined (JSON Schema Core §9.4.2). An author instead copies such a schema in, translating it as [§5.2](#52-schemas) describes, or references a schema published as a schema document of its own.

Dynamic resolution can still cross back. When evaluation begins in the document resource, a `$dynamicRef` inside an `$id` resource whose initially resolved fragment was created by `$dynamicAnchor` can resolve, through the dynamic scope, to a `$dynamicAnchor` of the document resource (JSON Schema Core §8.2.3.2). A `$dynamicAnchor` declared anywhere in the document resource can therefore capture such a reference in a schema written without it in mind. For a same-document reference in the document resource, resolution percent-decodes the fragment before classifying it ([§7.2](#72-the-document-as-embedding)), which a JSON Schema library may not do; a tool makes its resolver follow that reading, adapting its library where necessary, and authors write plain names unencoded.

A JSON Schema library reads `schemas`, `operations`, and the document's other members as unknown keywords, so it neither finds the `$id`s and anchors at OBI positions nor reliably resolves pointers into them (JSON Schema Core §9.4.2). A tool therefore locates those identifiers itself, as [OpenAPI](#132-informative-references) requires of its tools, and presents them to its library. For example, it can give the document a base URI used nowhere else, such as a fresh `urn:uuid:` URI; resolve same-document references against the document root under that base; register each schema resource an `$id` declares under its resolved `$id`, in a registry of the document's own ([§9](#9-security-considerations)); and resolve the document resource's plain names itself, since the library cannot find them. Dynamic references need one more step: when evaluation begins in the document resource, its `$dynamicAnchor`s are in the dynamic scope ([§7.2](#72-the-document-as-embedding)) though the library does not know them, so a tool makes them known to the library or, where a `$dynamicRef` could resolve to one, reports no verdict ([OBI-T-08](#103-tool-rules)). Evaluating an operation's schema in isolation leaves its references to the document's other schemas unresolved and, without an `$id`, reads its same-document references from the wrong root.

---

## 8. Versioning

OBI documents carry two independent version concepts: the specification version the document is written against, and an author-controlled label for the interface itself.

### 8.1. `openbindings` field (specification version)

The `openbindings` field identifies the version of this specification the document declares: a [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) string ([OBI-D-09](#102-document-rules)).

**Lines.** A document is interpreted under the `major.minor` line its version names. Each line is one document model: a patch release corrects errors in this text without adding fields or changing what documents mean, though a correction can change a document's conformance (invariant 5). A patch release's corrections apply to the whole line, so the patch number a document declares carries no meaning: `0.2.0` and `0.2.1` are read alike, under the text of the patch release a processor applies ([OBI-T-09](#103-tool-rules)).

**Processing.** Support is per line ([OBI-T-04](#103-tool-rules)), and supporting one line implies nothing about another. From 1.0.0 onward a new minor is backward-compatible with documents written to the previous minor, while pre-1.0 minors MAY break (release policy, below).

- A prerelease (`0.2.0-rc.1`) is a distinct, potentially incompatible draft outside its line, identified by its full version; a processor that explicitly includes it interprets the document under the draft's text and derived schema.
- Build metadata is permitted, has no OpenBindings semantics, and is ignored when determining support: `0.2.0+build.1` denotes the same line as `0.2.0`.
- Interpreting a document means giving any member other than `openbindings` the meaning a line assigns, as resolving names, comparing kinds, following references, validating values, and judging conformance do. A **version refusal** prohibits only that: a processor MAY still parse, preserve, display, or route an unsupported document, which may conform to the version it declares. Showing an unsupported document's members as JSON is display; presenting its `operations` entries as operations, or its bindings under their operations, is interpretation.
- [OBI-T-04](#103-tool-rules) defines when a text declares a version and how a processor treats one that declares none; a validator that establishes that a text declares none reports its non-conformance under any line it supports ([OBI-T-09](#103-tool-rules)).
- Unknown fields have no core meaning under a supported line ([OBI-T-02](#103-tool-rules)); that rule does not authorize interpreting an unsupported line by ignoring its additions.

**Version declaration examples (informative).** When a processor that supports only the 0.2 line, and explicitly includes no prerelease, is asked to interpret each text below, where `<FF>` stands for a single byte 0xFF and `<BOM>` for the UTF-8 byte-order mark:

| Text | Declared version | Outcome |
| ---- | ---------------- | ----------------------- |
| `{"openbindings":"0.2.0","operations":{}}` | 0.2.0 | It may interpret the text under 0.2. |
| `{"openbindings":"0.2.7","operations":{}}` | 0.2.7 | It may interpret the text under 0.2; the patch number carries no meaning. |
| `{"openbindings":"0.2.0+build.5","operations":{}}` | 0.2.0+build.5 | It may interpret the text under 0.2; build metadata is ignored. |
| `{"openbindings":"0.3.0","operations":{}}` | 0.3.0 | Version refusal. |
| `{"openbindings":"0.2.0-rc.1","operations":{}}` | 0.2.0-rc.1 | Version refusal. |
| `{"openbindings":"0.3.0","description":"x<FF>","operations":{}}` | 0.3.0 | Version refusal; the ill-formed byte is OBI-D-01's, which only a supported line judges. |
| `{"openbindings":"0.3.0","operations":{},"operations":{}}` | 0.3.0 | Version refusal; the repeated `operations` member is likewise OBI-D-01's. |
| `{"openbindings":"0.2.0","description":"x<FF>","operations":{}}` | 0.2.0 | It may interpret the text under 0.2, where it is non-conformant under OBI-D-01. |
| `<BOM>{"openbindings":"0.3.0","operations":{}}` | None | No refusal; non-conformant under OBI-D-01. |
| `{"openbindings":"0.3.0","operations":{}}` encoded as UTF-16 without a byte-order mark | None: its zero bytes break the grammar | No refusal; non-conformant under OBI-D-01. |
| `{"openbindings":"0.3.<FF>0","operations":{}}` | None: the value is not SemVer after replacement | No refusal; non-conformant under OBI-D-01. |
| `{"openbindings":"0.3.0","description":"\u12<FF>4","operations":{}}` | None: the broken escape breaks the grammar | No refusal; non-conformant under OBI-D-01. |
| `{"openbindings":"0.3","operations":{}}` | None | No refusal; non-conformant under OBI-D-02 and OBI-D-09. |
| `{"openbindings":2,"operations":{}}` | None | No refusal; non-conformant under OBI-D-02 and OBI-D-09. |
| `{"operations":{}}` | None | No refusal; non-conformant under OBI-D-02 and OBI-D-09. |
| `{"openbindings":"0.2.0","openbindings":"0.3.0","operations":{}}` | None: the member is repeated | One that sees the repetition makes no refusal; the text is non-conformant under OBI-D-01. One whose parser cannot tell may decide from the value it reads, interpreting under 0.2 or refusing. |

Where the table says a text is non-conformant, that is what a validator applying the 0.2 line reports.

**Release policy.** While pre-1.0, minor versions MAY include breaking changes, per pre-1.0 SemVer convention. Changes to the provisions [§6](#6-kinds) lists as those a kind stands on are recorded in the changelog as breaking: a commitment about this specification's own provisions, not a compatibility judgment about external behavior. Declaring the earliest line sufficient for a document's content maximizes the processors able to interpret it.

### 8.2. `version` field (interface-version label)

The optional `version` field is the author's label for the described interface: a non-empty string that tools may preserve, display, index, or group by its exact value. This specification gives it no other meaning: no order, compatibility, or identity, and no effect on resolution, selection, or refusal. Authors MAY follow SemVer, dates, or any other convention; any stronger reading comes from an external catalog, registry, or organizational policy.

---

## 9. Security considerations

Processing OBI documents involves parsing untrusted JSON, optionally obtaining external artifacts and schemas, resolving references, and acting on `content` that may include author-supplied expressions. The threat surface is comparable to that of JSON Schema processors and artifact-consuming tools generally (SSRF, resource exhaustion, untrusted code evaluation, content confusion); the document format creates the following exposure:

- **URIs as attack vectors.** Addresses a tool reads from a source's or binding's `content`, and schema `$ref` values, may resolve to arbitrary endpoints, network or local, including internal or link-local addresses such as `http://169.254.169.254/...` and local files such as `file:///etc/passwd`. Unrestricted dereferencing inherits SSRF and exfiltration exposure.
- **Unbounded size.** The specification caps the size of neither OBI documents nor the artifacts and schemas they reference; untrusted input creates memory and processing-time exhaustion exposure.
- **Regular-expression cost.** Schema `pattern` and `patternProperties` values run on the evaluating tool's regular-expression engine; a backtracking engine can take exponential time on crafted input.
- **Schema `$ref` cycles.** Permitted by [§7](#7-reference-resolution); naive resolvers can exhaust the stack or loop indefinitely.
- **Identifier shadowing.** An `$id` can claim any URI, including a meta-schema's or one another document declares; a tool that registers the schema resources of every document it reads in one shared registry lets one document change how another's references, or its meta-schema lookups, resolve (JSON Schema Core §13).
- **Executable content.** A tool may interpret expressions or other executable material within `content`; untrusted documents can embed expressions designed to run without bound or to reach host state, and evaluation environment and limits are per-tool policy.
- **Dependencies are not trust claims.** A matching operation name or kind establishes neither provider authenticity nor authorization. Composition tooling that discovers or selects a provider inherits the risks of acting on untrusted interface metadata and applies its own trust, credential, and network policy before use.
- **Integrity is out of scope.** Authenticity and integrity are established by external means (transport security, content signing, out-of-band attestation) or not at all, and [Appendix A](#appendix-a-canonical-serialization-informative) names a deterministic serialization such systems can build on.

Mitigation is a processor concern; the specification mandates no mitigation policy.

### 9.1. Recommended mitigations (informative)

Categories of mitigation that tools processing OBI documents from untrusted origins typically consider; limits and defaults depend on deployment.

- **Scheme allow-list** for URI dereferencing: rejecting `file://`, `data:`, and schemes outside an explicit allow-list by default is common practice.
- **Network-range restrictions.** Refusing to dereference URIs resolving to link-local (`169.254.0.0/16`, `fe80::/10`), loopback (`127.0.0.0/8`, `::1`), private (RFC 1918, `fc00::/7`), or carrier-grade NAT (`100.64.0.0/10`) ranges by default, with explicit operator opt-in. A complete treatment checks the IANA special-purpose registries, normalizes IPv4-mapped IPv6 forms before comparison, and applies the check after DNS resolution, per redirect hop.
- **Size caps** on fetched documents, schemas, and source artifacts.
- **Timeouts** on fetches and on evaluating any expressions `content` carries.
- **Linear-time regular expressions**, or time limits on matching, for schema patterns.
- **Expression isolation.** Where a tool evaluates expressions in `content`, doing so without host access and with bounded time and memory.
- **Transport security.** Enforcing TLS for non-loopback origins, and distinguishing the URI a document was requested at from the URI a redirect resolved to when deriving any cache key. This specification assigns the document no canonical identity, and no OBI-defined reference resolves against either URI (invariant 4); an external schema's own references follow JSON Schema ([§7.4](#74-other-references)).
- **Per-document schema registries.** Registering the schema resources each document declares apart from other documents' and from the meta-schemas a tool relies on.
- **Reference-cycle detection.** Bounding traversals through recursive schemas and through any transitive references a tool follows in `content`.

---

## 10. Conformance

Conformance is judged by the numbered rules below alone: a document conforms when it meets the rules of [§10.2](#102-document-rules), and a tool when it meets the rules of [§10.3](#103-tool-rules) that apply to it. The other sections define and explain the model those rules apply to, and the text marked *Note* in a rule, which runs to the rule's end, explains it and adds no requirement.

The prose defines the document model; `openbindings.schema.json` expresses its structural part in JSON Schema, and the structural requirements of [§5](#5-document-model) take effect through OBI-D-02 (the schema's `$id` names the line, its title the patch release). The schema also expresses OBI-D-03, OBI-D-09, the name syntax of the references OBI-D-07, OBI-D-08, and OBI-D-11 check, and part of OBI-D-04 (an alias repeated within one operation's `aliases`). For OBI-D-06 it checks only the value of a `$schema` at the top of each operation `input` and `output` and each `schemas` entry ([§5.2](#52-schemas)). A document violating those parts violates OBI-D-02 as well; the other document rules walk the document beyond what the schema expresses.

**The document and its data.** Conformance is a property of a JSON text; a claim about an in-memory value is a claim about its serialization as UTF-8 JSON text with no byte-order mark, each number written at its exact value. Document rules read the text as RFC 8259 defines it: member names are compared as the sequences of code units they denote after unescaping (RFC 8259 §8.3), and numbers by their exact decimal value. A validator whose parser cannot represent a name or number exactly has not decided a clause that depends on it. OBI-D-02 through OBI-D-13 govern the JSON value only when OBI-D-01 holds. If OBI-D-01 is violated, those rules impose no further requirements and are not applicable in the vacuous sense of [§10.4](#104-conformance-conclusions); the OBI-D-01 violation alone establishes non-conformance. A validator that has not decided OBI-D-01 may check the value it parsed, provided the data used by the check would be exact if OBI-D-01 held. A failed check then establishes that either OBI-D-01 is violated or the checked rule is violated, and therefore establishes non-conformance. It does not necessarily establish which rule is violated. [OBI-T-04](#103-tool-rules)'s version-declaration test is unchanged.

Each rule carries an identifier (`OBI-D-##` document rules, `OBI-T-##` tool rules) for validators, test suites, and errata to cite. A rule is cited under a line ([§8.1](#81-openbindings-field-specification-version)): an identifier means what that line's text says, another line may number its rules differently, and a patch release adds and renumbers no rule.

### 10.1. Tool obligations

A tool's obligations follow what it does and claims, not a fixed class; each tool rule states its trigger. OBI-T-04 binds every processor, including one that does no more than read a document (to parse, index, or render it), and OBI-T-03 every processor that interprets one. A processor MAY also report document conformance, resolve references, validate values against value contracts, or resolve operation names, each bringing the rules scoped to it, and MAY act on sources, which is outside this specification: invoking a binding by itself triggers no additional core rule (invariant 2). There is no central registry of tool capabilities, and the published conformance test corpus is reference material outside this specification: a rule without fixtures is no less binding.

The table below (informative) maps each capability to the tool rules it brings, listing the document rules where a validator decides them. It is no class hierarchy; rows apply in any order consistent with OBI-T-04, which decides whether this line applies before a conclusion or other interpretation.

| Capability | Rules and sections |
| ---------- | ------------------ |
| Decide whether this specification applies (all processors) | OBI-T-04, [§8.1](#81-openbindings-field-specification-version) |
| Treat `x-` fields as extensions when interpreting a document | OBI-T-03, [§12](#12-extensions) |
| Interpret OBI-defined fields | OBI-T-02, [§5](#5-document-model), [§12](#12-extensions) |
| Validate and report document conformance | OBI-D-01 through OBI-D-13, OBI-T-09, OBI-T-10, [§10.4](#104-conformance-conclusions) |
| Resolve an operation identifier | OBI-T-07, [§5.1](#51-operations) |
| Interpret or compare kinds | OBI-T-01, [§5.5](#55-dependencies), [§6](#6-kinds) |
| Resolve schema references | OBI-T-06, [§7](#7-reference-resolution) |
| Validate operation-boundary values | OBI-T-08, [§5.2](#52-schemas) |
| Derive another form from a schema | OBI-T-05, [§5.2](#52-schemas) |
| Check examples | OBI-T-11, [§5.1](#51-operations) |
| Resolve or act on a binding target | The source's kind ([§6](#6-kinds)) |

### 10.2. Document rules

Document rules bind the document, and none evaluates a value against the document's schemas. A validator that lacks the capability a clause needs leaves that clause inconclusive, which is not a violation ([§10.4](#104-conformance-conclusions)).

A conformant **OBI document**:

- **OBI-D-01**: Is valid UTF-8 ([RFC 3629](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3629)) encoded JSON per [RFC 8259](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8259). Duplicate JSON object keys within any object make the document non-conformant. A leading byte-order mark makes the document non-conformant. *Note:* RFC 8259 §8.1 forbids adding a byte-order mark, and tolerating one would let two parsers disagree over the same bytes. Rejecting duplicate names follows interoperable-JSON practice ([RFC 7493](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7493) §2.3); most JSON parsers silently keep one duplicate value, so checking the duplicate clause requires a duplicate-detecting parse.
- **OBI-D-02**: Validates against the derived JSON Schema published with the release of this specification whose text the document is judged under, for a line or for a prerelease (`openbindings.schema.json`, `$id` `https://openbindings.com/schema/openbindings-0.2.json`), its `pattern` values read as ECMA-262 regular expressions. Where the schema and the prose disagree, the schema decides this rule until a patch release corrects the erratum; a patch release that corrects the schema republishes it under the same `$id`.
- **OBI-D-03**: Has every map key this specification defines (operation, dependency, binding, source, schema, and example keys) and every entry of an operation's `aliases` array a string matching `^[A-Za-z0-9_][A-Za-z0-9_.-]*$`, an ECMA-262 regular expression matched against the whole name. An `aliases` member that is not an array is OBI-D-02's alone. Property names inside JSON Schema objects are schema content, not map keys, and are unconstrained by this rule.
- **OBI-D-04**: Has no string occurring more than once among all operations' keys and `aliases` entries taken together.
- **OBI-D-05**: Has every schema `$ref` and `$dynamicRef` in the document resource ([§3](#3-terminology)) an absolute URI or a same-document reference, and every schema `$id` at an OBI position an absolute URI, all of them well-formed URI-references per [RFC 3986](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986) §4.1 ([§7.1](#71-reference-forms)).
- **OBI-D-06**: Has every `$schema` keyword in a schema the document contains ([§3](#3-terminology)) equal to `https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema` or `https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema#`.
- **OBI-D-07**: Has every `bindings[*].operation` value present as a key in the document's `operations` map.
- **OBI-D-08**: Has every `bindings[*].source` value present as a key in the document's `sources` map.
- **OBI-D-09**: Has an `openbindings` field whose value is a valid [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) string.
- **OBI-D-10**: Has every operation `input` and `output` and every entry in `schemas` valid against the JSON Schema 2020-12 meta-schemas (the dialect meta-schema `https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema` and the vocabulary meta-schemas it references, as published with [JSON Schema Core](#131-normative-references)), which validate its subschemas in turn ([§5.2](#52-schemas)). The meta-schemas apply with `format` as an annotation, JSON Schema's default (JSON Schema Validation §7.2.1), and with their `pattern` values read as ECMA-262 regular expressions, the dialect JSON Schema names (JSON Schema Core §6.4). *Note:* the pinned meta-schemas make the rule decidable offline; it resolves none of the document's references.
- **OBI-D-11**: Has every `dependencies[*].operation` value present as a key in the document's `operations` map.
- **OBI-D-12**: Has every same-document schema `$ref` and `$dynamicRef` in the document resource identifying a schema at an OBI position, its fragment read after percent-decoding (a fragment that does not decode to valid UTF-8 identifies nothing). An empty reference or an empty fragment never qualifies; a fragment beginning with `/` qualifies only as a valid JSON Pointer to a schema at an OBI position; any other fragment qualifies only as a plain name declared with `$anchor` or `$dynamicAnchor` by a schema in the document resource ([§3](#3-terminology), [§7.3](#73-same-document-references)). Absolute URIs and references within a schema resource that declares `$id` are outside this rule. *Note:* the check is a lookup in the document; it resolves no other reference and evaluates no value.
- **OBI-D-13**: Has no plain name ([§7.3](#73-same-document-references)) declared more than once in the document resource, each `$anchor` and each `$dynamicAnchor` that declares it counting once (JSON Schema Core §8.2.2), and no `$id` declared by two schemas the document contains. For that comparison, each `$id` is resolved to an absolute URI per RFC 3986 §5.2 (which removes dot segments), stripped of any empty fragment, and compared character for character. An `$id` is compared only when it is a well-formed URI-reference that is either an absolute URI or resolves against the `$id` of the nearest enclosing schema that declares one, itself compared; every other `$id` is left out of the comparison ([§7.4](#74-other-references)).

### 10.3. Tool rules

A conformant **tool** meets each of the following that applies to it. Each item states its requirements with BCP 14 keywords and may define the terms it uses.

- **OBI-T-01** (applies when interpreting a kind string, including deciding whether a binding meets a dependency's `kinds` constraint or reporting whether two kinds are the same): A tool MUST compare complete kind strings by exact equality. It MUST NOT normalize, case-fold, or decompose kinds or infer compatibility or version order from their spelling, and MUST NOT dereference a kind merely because it resembles a URI. *Note:* whether a processor supports a kind or acts on a source is its own capability and policy; lack of support changes neither document conformance nor the result of a `kinds` comparison ([§5.5](#55-dependencies)).
- **OBI-T-02** (applies when interpreting OBI-defined fields): A tool MUST give each field this specification defines the meaning defined for it, presence included ([§5](#5-document-model)), and MUST give an unknown field no core meaning. *Note:* "field" is defined in [§3](#3-terminology). An unknown field whose name does not begin with `x-` makes the document non-conformant under OBI-D-02 ([§12](#12-extensions)).
- **OBI-T-03** (applies when interpreting a document): A processor MUST treat fields whose names begin with `x-` as extensions, and MUST NOT let an `x-` field, whether or not it understands it, change the meaning of core fields. *Note:* a processor may act on an `x-` field it understands in ways that leave that meaning intact.
- **OBI-T-04** (all processors): A processor MUST NOT interpret a document that declares a version under this specification's semantics unless it supports that version: the `major.minor` line of a release version, or a prerelease the processor explicitly includes. Asked to interpret a document whose declared version it does not support, it MUST produce a version refusal instead, reported distinctly from document non-conformance. A text declares a version exactly when it has no byte-order mark and parses under the JSON grammar (RFC 8259 §2) as an object with exactly one `openbindings` member, whose value is a string that is a SemVer version. For that test the text is decoded as UTF-8 (RFC 3629) from left to right, each well-formed sequence read as its character and each other byte replaced by U+FFFD. A processor MUST NOT produce a version refusal for a text that declares no version, which is non-conformant under OBI-D-01 or OBI-D-09, except that a processor whose parser cannot tell whether the `openbindings` member is repeated MAY, when every other condition holds, treat the text as declaring the version its parser reads. A processor MUST make the line decision for a text that declares a version even when the text's encoding or repeated names elsewhere violate OBI-D-01, which only a supported line's rules judge. [§8.1](#81-openbindings-field-specification-version) governs prerelease and build-metadata handling and what a refusal prohibits and permits. *Note:* the replacement only locates the version, and OBI-D-01 still judges the bytes: a replacement among the unescaped characters of a string other than the `openbindings` member's name or value leaves the decision unchanged, while one in that name or value, within an escape, or between tokens leaves the text declaring no version. Any decoder that replaces ill-formed input without consuming an ASCII byte, such as one following the Unicode Standard's maximal-subpart practice, reaches the same decision. A repeated member makes a text non-conformant under this line (OBI-D-01), so the parser latitude falls only on texts this line rejects.
- **OBI-T-05** (applies when claiming to derive another form from a schema, such as a type through code generation or a model for comparison): A tool MUST NOT claim that the derived form preserves the schema's meaning when semantically significant keywords or values it cannot represent could change that meaning. *Note:* whether and how it reports a narrower result or an unsupported feature is its own concern.
- **OBI-T-06** (applies when resolving `$ref` or `$dynamicRef` values): When it resolves a schema reference, a tool MUST resolve it as [§5.2](#52-schemas) and [§7](#7-reference-resolution) define: a same-document reference in the document resource against the OBI document, and every other reference as JSON Schema defines ([§7.4](#74-other-references)). It MUST NOT treat a reference cycle alone as an invalid reference or a schema mismatch. *Note:* implementation strategy and resource limits are its own concerns.
- **OBI-T-07** (applies when resolving operation names): A tool MUST resolve a name against the flat namespace of operation identifiers (each operation's key together with its `aliases`), treating key and alias matches as equally authoritative. It MUST NOT privilege key matches over alias matches, and MUST NOT resolve a name to an operation unless the name exactly equals one of that operation's identifiers (no trimming, case-folding, or approximate matching). When finding a resolved operation's bindings, it MUST find them by the operation's key (the value in `bindings[*].operation`), not by the alias used to reach it. *Note:* OBI-D-04 makes the namespace document-unique, so a name resolves to at most one operation.
- **OBI-T-08** (applies when claiming to validate a value against an operation's `input` or `output` schema): A tool MUST evaluate the value under the schema's applicable JSON Schema dialect, treating `format` as an annotation where the dialect leaves its assertion optional, as OBI-D-10 does, and reading `pattern` values and `patternProperties` names as ECMA-262 regular expressions with Unicode semantics (the `u` flag or equivalent, JSON Schema Core §6.4), with the OBI document as the resolution context for embedded schemas: its own resource and every resource an `$id` declares in the schemas it contains ([§5.2](#52-schemas), [§7](#7-reference-resolution)). It MUST apply the operation schema to each value it validates separately, never to a sequence of values as a whole. It MUST NOT report either validation success or an instance mismatch that depends on a required reference or capability it does not have, or on an **undefined result**: one JSON Schema leaves undefined (such as the result of evaluating a cycle that recurses without consuming any of the instance, [§7.4](#74-other-references), JSON Schema Core §9.4.1), or one the readings this rule fixes leave undefined, because it depends on a keyword value they make invalid (such as a pattern that is not a valid ECMA-262 regular expression with Unicode semantics). It MUST NOT report any verdict, success included, for a value checked against an absent `input` or `output`, which states no value contract ([§5.1](#51-operations)). *Note:* an undefined result withholds a verdict from every tool; a missing reference or capability, only from a tool that lacks it. This rule does not require a whole-graph readiness check or prescribe evaluation strategy, resource acquisition, or report shape; invoking, rendering, or indexing alone does not trigger validation. A tool may check formats as a report of its own, apart from this rule's verdict.
- **OBI-T-09** (applies when reporting a conclusion about overall document conformance): A tool MUST NOT claim conformance unless every applicable document rule has been established with no violation, MUST NOT claim non-conformance unless it has established a violation of an applicable document rule, and MUST report non-conformance when it has established one. It MUST NOT report conformance as undetermined when every applicable document rule has been established with no violation. It MUST name the release of this specification whose text it applied: a patch release, a prerelease it explicitly includes, or, before a version's first release, its working draft and the source-control revision of the text applied. *Note:* absence of a found violation alone does not establish conformance ([§10.4](#104-conformance-conclusions)); the release is named because a patch release can correct the text a conclusion rests on ([§8.1](#81-openbindings-field-specification-version)).
- **OBI-T-10** (applies when reporting document conformance): A tool MUST NOT treat the apparent inaccuracy of an author claim, as [§5](#5-document-model) lists them, as a document-rule violation.
- **OBI-T-11** (applies when checking examples): A tool MUST NOT resolve an example–schema mismatch by treating the example as an exception: the schema is authoritative, and an example never widens, narrows, or overrides it ([§5.1](#51-operations)).

These rules fix the meaning of core fields and what the claims made under them assert. Whether to act on a valid document or continue with a non-conformant one, and how to diagnose and serialize reports, are the tool's, with the other tool concerns of [§1.2](#12-out-of-scope).

### 10.4. Conformance conclusions

A document is objectively conformant or non-conformant under this specification (invariant 5); a validator may also lack enough evidence to decide. The possible conclusions ([OBI-T-09](#103-tool-rules)):

| Conclusion                   | Exact meaning                                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Conformant**               | Every applicable document rule was decided and no violation established.           |
| **Non-conformant**           | At least one violation of an applicable document rule was established, whatever remains inconclusive. |
| **Conformance undetermined** | No violation established, but one or more applicable rules remain inconclusive.    |

A tool need not report a positive conclusion merely because it has established conformance. Withholding that report does not make any rule inconclusive: if the tool reports a conclusion, that conclusion has the meaning above. In particular, "conformance undetermined" does not describe complete evidence that establishes conformance.

A version refusal ([OBI-T-04](#103-tool-rules)) is reported instead of a conclusion. The applicable rules are those of [§10.2](#102-document-rules) for the line or prerelease the document is interpreted under, as stated in the release the conclusion names ([OBI-T-09](#103-tool-rules)); a rule with nothing to govern in a particular document holds vacuously, and a tool may record it as satisfied or as not applicable. A tool may describe rule-level evidence as **satisfied** (the rule was established to hold), **violated** (established not to hold), **inconclusive** (neither established), or **not applicable**, and may name the governing rule identifiers; an unavailable resource, missing capability, or exceeded resource limit is not by itself evidence of a violation. Scoped claims such as "valid against the derived structural schema" are possible when their scope is clear, and a tool defines its own API, report vocabulary, serialization, and any ladder of validation levels.

## 11. IANA considerations

This specification defines the registration details for the OpenBindings JSON media type. The IANA registries are authoritative for current registration status.

Per [RFC 6838](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6838), under the vendor tree:

- **Type name:** application
- **Subtype name:** vnd.openbindings+json
- **Required parameters:** none
- **Optional parameters:** none
- **Encoding considerations:** binary, as for `application/json` ([RFC 8259](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8259)); OBI documents are UTF-8 encoded JSON ([OBI-D-01](#102-document-rules))
- **Security considerations:** see [§9. Security considerations](#9-security-considerations)
- **Interoperability considerations:** see [§10. Conformance](#10-conformance)
- **Published specification:** this specification
- **Applications that use this media type:** tools that produce or consume OpenBindings documents
- **Fragment identifier considerations:** JSON Pointer per [RFC 6901](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6901), or a plain name declared by `$anchor` or `$dynamicAnchor` in the document resource ([§7.2](#72-the-document-as-embedding); JSON Schema Core §8.2.2). Such a fragment identifies a location in the representation; the document resource itself has no portable, externally nameable base, so its schemas cannot be addressed from outside the document as schema resources ([§7.5](#75-notes-for-authors-and-tools-informative))
- **Additional information:** deprecated alias names, magic numbers, file extensions, and Macintosh file type codes: none
- **Person and email address to contact for further information:** the OpenBindings maintainers, hello@openbindings.com; see also [github.com/openbindings](https://github.com/openbindings)
- **Intended usage:** COMMON
- **Restrictions on usage:** none
- **Author:** the OpenBindings maintainers
- **Change controller:** openbindings project

## 12. Extensions

OBI documents MAY include extension fields, whose names begin with `x-`, in any OBI-defined object ([§3](#3-terminology), Field). Unprefixed names are reserved ([§5](#5-document-model), [OBI-D-02](#102-document-rules)) so this specification can add fields without colliding with a document's own data, and an unknown one has no core meaning ([OBI-T-02](#103-tool-rules)). [OBI-T-03](#103-tool-rules) keeps an `x-` field from changing the meaning of core fields; whether a processor preserves one it does not understand, or declines work that depends on it, is a tool concern.

Keys inside the document's maps (`operations`, `dependencies`, `sources`, `bindings`, `schemas`, and an operation's `examples`) are entry names, not fields: an `x-`-prefixed key there names an ordinary entry, subject to OBI-D-03 like any other key, and in `operations` it enters the identifier namespace (OBI-D-04).

## Appendix A. Canonical serialization (informative)

Some applications need a stable byte representation of an OBI document: content addressing, integrity attestation, signature systems, cache keys, prompt-cache stability. This appendix names one so tools and downstream specifications can refer to it consistently; conformance requires neither JCS-compatible input nor that any processor implement canonicalization.

For an OBI whose parsed JSON value satisfies the input requirements of [RFC 8785 (JSON Canonicalization Scheme)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8785), its JCS serialization provides deterministic bytes for the carried JSON value, and carries that value exactly when every number's exact decimal value survives JCS's binary64 rendering (below). The facility is **partial**: RFC 8785 constrains its input to the I-JSON subset ([RFC 7493](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7493): numbers representable in IEEE 754 binary64, strings expressible as Unicode), while this specification pins RFC 8259 JSON and JSON Schema 2020-12, which bound neither, so a conformant OBI may have no JCS serialization.

The facility is JCS over the value exactly as carried. Rounding, coercing, repairing, or otherwise changing a value to manufacture compatible input computes some other serialization, and incompatible input is reported as failure per RFC 8785; where canonical bytes feed hashes, signatures, or equality, silent coercion would attest to data other than what the author supplied. JCS also serializes each number from its binary64 value, so a number whose exact decimal value differs from the shortest rendering of that value (`1000000000000000128` is serialized as `1000000000000000100`) is not carried exactly. Under this specification's reading of numbers ([§10](#10-conformance)), such an OBI has no JCS serialization that carries its value exactly, though RFC 8785 itself does not reject it.

Canonical serialization is syntactic: JCS sorts object member names and preserves array order, and performs no semantic normalization such as rewriting `{}` to `true`, resolving or bundling references, inserting defaults, dropping unknown fields, or interpreting embedded `content`. Two OBIs that mean the same thing can have different canonical bytes, and equal bytes establish equal carried JSON data, not behavioral equivalence or document identity. Naming a serialization defines no integrity system ([§9](#9-security-considerations)): digest algorithms, signature envelopes, carrier fields, and trust policy belong to downstream specifications, and by default JCS covers only the JSON value carried in the OBI itself, never fetched external resources.
